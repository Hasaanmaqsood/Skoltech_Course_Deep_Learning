# Implementation structure 

This repository contains machine learning models and datasets for classification and segmentation tasks.

## Classification

The `classification` directory includes the Jupyter notebook used for training the classification model and the dataset used for training.

- `classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the model training code.
- `classification dataset`: Directory containing the dataset for classification.

## Segmentation

The `segmentation` directory contains the Jupyter notebook for segmentation model training, the trained model, and the corresponding dataset.

- `segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the model training code.
- `segm_model.pth`: Saved model weights for the segmentation model.
- `segmentation dataset`: Directory containing the dataset for segmentation.

## Requirements

## Detailed Description

- **classification/**: This directory includes the Jupyter notebook `classification.ipynb` that contains all the code for training classification models. It also houses the `classification dataset` directory, where all data necessary for classification tasks is stored.

- **segmentation/**: Similar to the classification section, this part contains `segmentation.ipynb` for segmentation model training, `segm_model.pth` for the saved model weights, and a `segmentation dataset` directory for storing segmentation-related data.

- **Readme.md**: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and any other important information for users or contributors.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python libraries required to run the project's notebooks. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

To begin working with the notebooks, ensure you have Python installed on your system, then install the necessary dependencies:
