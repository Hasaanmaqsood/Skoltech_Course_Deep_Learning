# Implementation structure 

This repository contains machine learning models and datasets for classification and segmentation tasks.

## Classification

The `classification` directory includes the Jupyter notebook used for training the classification model and the dataset used for training.

- `classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the model training code.
- `classification dataset`: Directory containing the dataset for classification.

## Segmentation

The `segmentation` directory contains the Jupyter notebook for segmentation model training, the trained model, and the corresponding dataset.

- `segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the model training code.
- `segm_model.pth`: Saved model weights for the segmentation model.
- `segmentation dataset`: Directory containing the dataset for segmentation.

## Requirements

To install the necessary libraries to run the notebooks, use the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
